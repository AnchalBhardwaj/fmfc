# Feature Management : Feedback Component

This sample application demonstrates use of the Force.com **Feature Management API** to implement a user **Feedback Component**. This allows you to track enablement of features and capture in your **License Management Org (LMO)** an **average feedback score per feature**. [You can read more about this component in my blog](https://andyinthecloud.com/2018/01/28/adding-user-feedback-to-your-package/).
